# Content Control POD bridge

`readiness-grant.mjs` reads the existing CONTENT_READINESS.json object supplied by
the authoritative MF process, requires a scoped approval backed by an upstream
event, and signs a short-lived grant. It never changes a business max_mode.
Invoke with server-loaded data only; do not accept caller-supplied readiness or
approval objects at a public route.

`event-inbox.mjs` verifies Content Control event signatures and transactionally
deduplicates delivery. Apply `001_event_inbox.sql` through the existing migration
owner, then bind acceptPodEvent to an authenticated internal POST endpoint. This
module is not yet mounted in the deployed MF core: its runtime source is not in
this repository root. Downstream observations do not count as verified profit.

Tests: `node --test integrations/pod/readiness-grant.test.mjs`.
The corresponding Content Control change documents all twelve acceptance gates
in POD_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md. Publishing stays disabled. Etsy pipelines are
outside this lane; their independent workflows are preserved.
